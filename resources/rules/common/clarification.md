# Ask Questions If Underspecified

## When to Use

Use when a request has multiple plausible interpretations or key details (objective, scope, constraints, environment, or safety) are unclear.

## When NOT to Use

Do not use when the request is already clear, or when a quick, low-risk discovery read can answer the missing details.

## Goal

Ask the minimum set of clarifying questions needed to avoid wrong work; do not start implementing until the must-have questions are answered (or the user explicitly approves proceeding with stated assumptions).

## Workflow

### 1) Decide whether the request is underspecified

Treat a request as underspecified if after exploring how to perform the work, some or all of the following are not clear:
- Define the objective (what should change vs stay the same)
- Define "done" (acceptance criteria, examples, edge cases)
- Define scope (which files/components/users are in/out)
- Define constraints (compatibility, performance, style, deps, time)
- Identify environment (language/runtime versions, OS, build/test runner)
- Clarify safety/reversibility (data migration, rollout/rollback, risk)

If multiple plausible interpretations exist, assume it is underspecified.

### 2) Ask must-have questions first (keep it small)

Ask 1-5 questions in the first pass. Prefer questions that eliminate whole branches of work.

Make questions easy to answer:
- Optimize for scannability (short, numbered questions; avoid paragraphs)
- Offer multiple-choice options when possible
- Suggest reasonable defaults when appropriate (mark them clearly)
- Include a fast-path response (e.g., reply `defaults` to accept all)
- Include a low-friction "not sure" option when helpful
- Structure options so the user can respond with compact decisions (e.g., `1b 2a 3c`)

### 3) Pause before acting

Until must-have answers arrive:
- Do not run commands, edit files, or produce a detailed plan that depends on unknowns
- Do perform a clearly labeled, low-risk discovery step only if it does not commit you to a direction

If the user explicitly asks you to proceed without answers:
- State your assumptions as a short numbered list
- Ask for confirmation; proceed only after they confirm or correct them

### 4) Confirm interpretation, then proceed

Once you have answers, restate the requirements in 1-3 sentences (including key constraints and what success looks like), then start work.

## Question Templates

```text
1) Scope?
a) Minimal change (default)
b) Refactor while touching the area
c) Not sure - use default

2) Compatibility target?
a) Current project defaults (default)
b) Also support older versions: <specify>
c) Not sure - use default

Reply with: defaults (or 1a 2a)
```

## Anti-patterns

- Don't ask questions you can answer with a quick, low-risk discovery read
- Don't ask open-ended questions if a tight multiple-choice or yes/no would eliminate ambiguity faster
