# Agent Triggering Examples: Best Practices

Complete guide to writing effective `<example>` blocks in agent descriptions for reliable triggering.

## Example Block Format

The standard format for triggering examples:

```markdown
<example>
Context: [Describe the situation - what led to this interaction]
user: "[Exact user message or request]"
assistant: "[How Claude should respond before triggering]"
<commentary>
[Explanation of why this agent should be triggered in this scenario]
</commentary>
assistant: "[How Claude triggers the agent - usually 'I'll use the [agent-name] agent...']"
</example>
```

## Anatomy of a Good Example

### Context

**Purpose:** Set the scene - what happened before the user's message

**Good contexts:**
```
Context: User just implemented a new authentication feature
Context: User has created a PR and wants it reviewed
Context: User is debugging a test failure
Context: After writing several functions without documentation
```

**Bad contexts:**
```
Context: User needs help (too vague)
Context: Normal usage (not specific)
```

### User Message

**Purpose:** Show the exact phrasing that should trigger the agent

**Good user messages:**
```
user: "I've added the OAuth flow, can you check it?"
user: "Review PR #123"
user: "Why is this test failing?"
user: "Add docs for these functions"
```

**Vary the phrasing:**
Include multiple examples with different phrasings for the same intent:
```
Example 1: user: "Review my code"
Example 2: user: "Can you check this implementation?"
Example 3: user: "Look over my changes"
```

### Assistant Response (Before Triggering)

**Purpose:** Show what Claude says before launching the agent

**Good responses:**
```
assistant: "I'll analyze your OAuth implementation."
assistant: "Let me review that PR for you."
assistant: "I'll investigate the test failure."
```

**Proactive example:**
```
assistant: "Great! Now let me review the code quality."
<commentary>
Code was just written, proactively trigger review agent.
</commentary>
```

### Commentary

**Purpose:** Explain the reasoning - WHY this agent should trigger

**Good commentary:**
```
<commentary>
User explicitly requested code review, trigger the code-reviewer agent.
</commentary>

// ... (5 lines trimmed)
PR analysis request matches pr-analyzer agent's expertise.
</commentary>
```

**Include decision logic:**
```
<commentary>
User wrote tests (Test tool used). The test-analyzer agent should check
test quality and coverage before continuing.
</commentary>
```

### Assistant Response (Triggering)

**Purpose:** Show how Claude invokes the agent

**Standard pattern:**
```
assistant: "I'll use the [agent-name] agent to [what it will do]."
```

**Examples:**
```
assistant: "I'll use the code-reviewer agent to analyze the changes."
assistant: "Let me use the test-generator agent to create comprehensive tests."
assistant: "I'll use the security-analyzer agent to check for vulnerabilities."
```

## Example Types

### Type 1: Explicit Request

User directly asks for what the agent does:

```markdown
<example>
Context: User explicitly requests security analysis
user: "Check my code for security vulnerabilities"
assistant: "I'll use the security-analyzer agent to perform a thorough security review."
<commentary>
Direct security analysis request triggers the security-analyzer agent.
</commentary>
</example>
```

### Type 2: Proactive Triggering

Agent triggers after relevant work without explicit request:

```markdown
<example>
Context: User just implemented database queries
user: "I've added the user search functionality"
assistant: "Great! Let me review it for security."
<commentary>
Database code written. Proactively trigger security-analyzer to check
for SQL injection and other database security issues.
</commentary>
assistant: "I'll use the security-analyzer agent to check the database code."
</example>
```

### Type 3: Implicit Request

User implies need without stating it directly:

```markdown
<example>
Context: User mentions code is hard to understand
user: "This code is confusing and hard to follow"
assistant: "I can help improve the code clarity."
<commentary>
User indicates complexity issues. Trigger code-simplifier agent to refactor
for better readability.
</commentary>
assistant: "I'll use the code-simplifier agent to suggest improvements."
</example>
```

### Type 4: Tool Usage Pattern

Agent triggers based on prior tool usage:

```markdown
<example>
Context: User made multiple edits to test files
user: "I've updated all the tests"
assistant: "Great! Let me verify test quality."
<commentary>
Multiple Edit tools used on test files. Proactively trigger test-quality-analyzer
to ensure tests follow best practices.
</commentary>
assistant: "I'll use the test-quality-analyzer agent to review the tests."
</example>
```

## Multiple Examples Strategy

### Cover Different Phrasings

```markdown
<example>
user: "Review my code"
[...]
</example>
// ... (8 lines trimmed)
[...]
</example>
```

### Cover Proactive and Reactive

```markdown
<example>
Context: User explicitly requests review
user: "Review my code for issues"
[...]
// ... (9 lines trimmed)
[...]
</example>
```

### Cover Edge Cases

```markdown
<example>
Context: Typical usage
user: "Check my PR"
[...]
// ... (8 lines trimmed)
</commentary>
</example>
```

## Common Mistakes

### ❌ Missing Context

```markdown
<example>
user: "Review my code"
assistant: "I'll use the code-reviewer agent."
</example>
```

**Why bad:** No context about what led to this request.

### ✅ With Context

```markdown
<example>
Context: User just finished implementing authentication
user: "Review my code"
assistant: "I'll use the code-reviewer agent to analyze the auth implementation."
<commentary>
Auth code written, review for security and best practices.
</commentary>
</example>
```

### ❌ No Commentary

```markdown
<example>
Context: User requests review
user: "Check my changes"
assistant: "I'll use the reviewer agent."
</example>
```

**Why bad:** Doesn't explain WHY agent triggers.

### ✅ With Commentary

```markdown
<example>
Context: User requests review after making changes
user: "Check my changes"
assistant: "I'll use the code-reviewer agent to analyze the modifications."
<commentary>
Code review request triggers agent to check quality, security, and adherence to standards.
</commentary>
</example>
```

### ❌ Agent Responds Directly

```markdown
<example>
user: "Review my code"
assistant: "I found the following issues: [lists issues]"
</example>
```

**Why bad:** Shows agent's output, not triggering.

### ✅ Shows Triggering

```markdown
<example>
user: "Review my code"
assistant: "I'll use the code-reviewer agent to perform the review."
<commentary>
Review request triggers the agent.
</commentary>
</example>
```

## How Many Examples?

### Minimum: 2 Examples

Cover at least:
1. Explicit request
2. One variation or proactive trigger

### Recommended: 3-4 Examples

Cover:
1. Explicit request (direct ask)
2. Implicit request (user implies need)
3. Proactive trigger (after relevant work)
4. Edge case or specific scenario

### Maximum: 6 Examples

More than 6 makes description too long. Focus on most important scenarios.

## Template Library

### Code Review Agent

```markdown
<example>
Context: User just implemented a new feature
user: "I've added the user registration feature"
assistant: "Great! Let me review the code quality."
<commentary>
// ... (10 lines trimmed)
Explicit review request triggers the agent.
</commentary>
</example>
```

### Test Generation Agent

```markdown
<example>
Context: User implemented functions without tests
user: "I've added the data processing functions"
assistant: "Great! Let me generate tests for these."
<commentary>
// ... (10 lines trimmed)
Direct test generation request triggers the agent.
</commentary>
</example>
```

### Documentation Agent

```markdown
<example>
Context: User added new API endpoints
user: "I've implemented the REST API endpoints"
assistant: "I'll document these endpoints."
<commentary>
// ... (10 lines trimmed)
Documentation request triggers the agent.
</commentary>
</example>
```

### Validation Agent

```markdown
<example>
Context: User ready to commit changes
user: "I'm ready to commit this code"
assistant: "Let me validate it first."
<commentary>
// ... (10 lines trimmed)
Explicit validation request triggers the agent.
</commentary>
</example>
```

## Debugging Triggering Issues

### Agent Not Triggering

**Check:**
1. Examples include relevant keywords from user message
2. Context matches actual usage scenarios
3. Commentary explains triggering logic clearly
4. Assistant shows use of Agent tool in examples

**Fix:**
Add more examples covering different phrasings.

### Agent Triggers Too Often

**Check:**
1. Examples are too broad or generic
2. Triggering conditions overlap with other agents
3. Commentary doesn't distinguish when NOT to use

**Fix:**
Make examples more specific, add negative examples.

### Agent Triggers in Wrong Scenarios

**Check:**
1. Examples don't match actual intended use
2. Commentary suggests inappropriate triggering

**Fix:**
Revise examples to show only correct triggering scenarios.

## Best Practices Summary

✅ **DO:**
- Include 2-4 concrete, specific examples
- Show both explicit and proactive triggering
- Provide clear context for each example
- Explain reasoning in commentary
- Vary user message phrasing
- Show Claude using Agent tool

❌ **DON'T:**
- Use generic, vague examples
- Omit context or commentary
- Show only one type of triggering
- Skip the agent invocation step
- Make examples too similar
- Forget to explain why agent triggers

## Conclusion

Well-crafted examples are crucial for reliable agent triggering. Invest time in creating diverse, specific examples that clearly demonstrate when and why the agent should be used.
