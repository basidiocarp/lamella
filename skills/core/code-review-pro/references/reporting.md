# Report Generation (Phase 6)

Comprehensive markdown report structure and formatting guidelines.

---

## Report Structure

Generate markdown report with these mandatory sections:

### 1. Executive Summary

- Severity distribution table
- Risk assessment (CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
- Final recommendation (APPROVE/REJECT/CONDITIONAL)
- Key metrics (test gaps, blast radius, red flags)

**Template:**
```markdown
# Executive Summary

| Severity | Count |
|----------|-------|
| 🔴 CRITICAL | X |
// ... (9 lines trimmed)
- Test coverage gaps: N functions
- High blast radius changes: M functions
- Security regressions detected: P
```

---

### 2. What Changed

- Commit timeline with visual
- File summary table
- Lines changed stats

**Template:**
```markdown
## What Changed

**Commit Range:** `base..head`
**Commits:** X
// ... (6 lines trimmed)

**Total:** +N, -M lines across K files
```

---

### 3. Critical Findings

For each HIGH/CRITICAL issue:

```markdown
### [SEVERITY] Title

**File**: path/to/file.ext:lineNumber
**Commit**: hash
**Blast Radius**: N callers (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
// ... (10 lines trimmed)
[Concrete exploitation steps from adversarial.md]

**Proof of Concept**:
```code demonstrating issue```

**Recommendation**:
[Specific fix with code]
```

**Example:**
```markdown
### 🔴 CRITICAL: Authorization Bypass in Withdraw

**File**: TokenVault.sol:156
**Commit**: abc123def
**Blast Radius**: 23 callers (HIGH)
**Test Coverage**: NO

**Description**:
Removed `require(msg.sender == owner)` check allows any user to withdraw funds.

**Historical Context**:
- Git blame: Added 2024-06-15 (commit def456)
- Message: "Add owner check per audit finding #45"
- Code existed to prevent unauthorized withdrawals

**Attack Scenario**:
1. Attacker calls `withdraw(1000 ether)`
2. No authorization check (removed)
3. 1000 ETH transferred to attacker
4. Protocol funds drained

**Proof of Concept**:
```solidity
// As any address
vault.withdraw(vault.balance());
// Success - funds stolen
```

**Recommendation**:
```solidity
function withdraw(uint256 amount) external {
+   require(msg.sender == owner, "Unauthorized");
    // ... rest of function
}
```
```

---

### 4. Test Coverage Analysis

- Coverage statistics
- Untested changes list
- Risk assessment

**Template:**
```markdown
## Test Coverage Analysis

**Coverage:** X% of changed code

**Untested Changes:**
| Function | Risk | Impact |
|----------|------|--------|
| functionA() | HIGH | No validation tests |
| functionB() | MEDIUM | Logic untested |

**Risk Assessment:**
N HIGH-risk functions without tests → Recommend blocking merge
```

---

### 5. Blast Radius Analysis

- High-impact functions table
- Dependency graph
- Impact quantification

**Template:**
```markdown
## Blast Radius Analysis

**High-Impact Changes:**
| Function | Callers | Risk | Priority |
|----------|---------|------|----------|
| transfer() | 89 | HIGH | P0 |
| validate() | 45 | MEDIUM | P1 |
```

---

### 6. Historical Context

- Security-related removals
- Regression risks
- Commit message red flags

**Template:**
```markdown
## Historical Context

**Security-Related Removals:**
- Line 45: `require` removed (added 2024-03 for CVE-2024-1234)
- Line 78: Validation removed (added 2023-12 "security hardening")

**Regression Risks:**
- Code pattern removed in commit X, re-added in commit Y
```

---

### 7. Recommendations

- Immediate actions (blocking)
- Before production (tracking)
- Technical debt (future)

**Template:**
```markdown
## Recommendations

### Immediate (Blocking)
- [ ] Fix CRITICAL issue in TokenVault.sol:156
- [ ] Add tests for withdraw() function

### Before Production
- [ ] Security audit of auth changes
- [ ] Load test blast radius functions

### Technical Debt
- [ ] Refactor validation pattern consistency
```

---

### 8. Analysis Methodology
// ... (7 lines trimmed)

**Template:**
```markdown
## Analysis Methodology

**Strategy:** FOCUSED (80 files, medium codebase)

**Analysis Scope:**
- Files reviewed: 45/80 (56%)
- HIGH RISK: 100% coverage
- MEDIUM RISK: 60% coverage
- LOW RISK: Excluded

**Techniques:**
- Git blame on all removals
- Blast radius calculation
- Test coverage analysis
- Adversarial modeling for HIGH RISK

**Limitations:**
- Did not analyze external dependencies
- Limited to 1-hop caller analysis

**Confidence:** HIGH for analyzed scope, MEDIUM overall
```

---

### 9. Appendices

// ... (8 lines trimmed)
**Tables:** Use markdown tables for structured data

**Code blocks:** Always include syntax highlighting
```solidity
// Solidity code
```
```rust
// Rust code
```

**Status indicators:**
- ✅ Complete
- ⚠️ Warning
// ... (7 lines trimmed)

**Before/After comparisons:**
```markdown
**BEFORE:**
```code
old code
```

**AFTER:**
```code
new code
```
```

**Line number references:** Always include
- Format: `file.sol:L123`
- Link to commit: `file.sol:L123 (commit abc123)`
// ... (9 lines trimmed)

**Filename format:**
```
<PROJECT>_DIFFERENTIAL_REVIEW_<DATE>.md

Example: VeChain_Stargate_DIFFERENTIAL_REVIEW_2025-12-26.md
```

## User Notification Template

After generating report:

```markdown
Report generated successfully!

📄 File: [filename]
📁 Location: [path]
📏 Size: XX KB
⏱️ Review Time: ~X hours

Summary:
- X findings (Y critical, Z high)
- Final recommendation: APPROVE/REJECT/CONDITIONAL
- Confidence: HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW

Next steps:
- Review findings in detail
- Address CRITICAL/HIGH issues before merge
- Consider chaining with issue-writer for stakeholder report
```

---

## Integration with issue-writer

After generating differential review, transform into audit report:

```bash
issue-writer --input DIFFERENTIAL_REVIEW_REPORT.md --format audit-report
```

This creates polished documentation for non-technical stakeholders.

---

## Error Handling

If file write fails:
1. Try Desktop location
2. Try temp directory
3. As last resort, output full report to chat
4. Notify user to save manually

**Always prioritize persistent artifact generation over ephemeral chat output.**
