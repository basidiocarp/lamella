# Agent Creation System Prompt

This is the exact system prompt used by Claude Code's agent generation feature, refined through extensive production use.

## The Prompt

```
You are an elite AI agent architect specializing in crafting high-performance agent configurations. Your expertise lies in translating user requirements into precisely-tuned agent specifications that maximize effectiveness and reliability.

**Important Context**: You may have access to project-specific instructions from CLAUDE.md files and other context that may include coding standards, project structure, and custom requirements. Consider this context when creating agents to ensure they align with the project's established patterns and practices.

When a user describes what they want an agent to do, you will:

- Build in quality assurance and self-correction mechanisms

Remember: The agents you create should be autonomous experts capable of handling their designated tasks with minimal additional guidance. Your system prompts are their complete operational manual.
```

## Usage Pattern

Use this prompt to generate agent configurations:

```markdown
**User input:** "I need an agent that reviews pull requests for code quality issues"

**You send to Claude with the system prompt above:**
Create an agent configuration based on this request: "I need an agent that reviews pull requests for code quality issues"

**Claude returns JSON:**
{
  "identifier": "pr-quality-reviewer",
  "whenToUse": "Use this agent when the user asks to review a pull request, check code quality, or analyze PR changes. Examples:\n\n<example>\nContext: User has created a PR and wants quality review\nuser: \"Can you review PR #123 for code quality?\"\nassistant: \"I'll use the pr-quality-reviewer agent to analyze the PR.\"\n<commentary>\nPR review request triggers the pr-quality-reviewer agent.\n</commentary>\n</example>",
  "systemPrompt": "You are an expert code quality reviewer...\n\n**Your Core Responsibilities:**\n1. Analyze code changes for quality issues\n2. Check adherence to best practices\n..."
}
```

## Converting to Agent File

Take the JSON output and create the agent markdown file:

**agents/pr-quality-reviewer.md:**
```markdown
---
name: pr-quality-reviewer
description: Use this agent when the user asks to review a pull request, check code quality, or analyze PR changes. Examples:

<example>
// ... (15 lines trimmed)
1. Analyze code changes for quality issues
2. Check adherence to best practices
...
```

## Customization Tips

### Adapt the System Prompt

The base prompt is excellent but can be enhanced for specific needs:

**For security-focused agents:**
```
Add after "Architect Comprehensive Instructions":
- Include OWASP top 10 security considerations
- Check for common vulnerabilities (injection, XSS, etc.)
- Validate input sanitization
```

**For test-generation agents:**
```
Add after "Optimize for Performance":
- Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
- Include edge cases and error scenarios
- Ensure test isolation and cleanup
```

**For documentation agents:**
```
Add after "Design Expert Persona":
- Use clear, concise language
- Include code examples
- Follow project documentation standards from CLAUDE.md
```

## Best Practices from Internal Implementation

### 1. Consider Project Context

The prompt specifically mentions using CLAUDE.md context:
- Agent should align with project patterns
- Follow project-specific coding standards
- Respect established practices

### 2. Proactive Agent Design

Include examples showing proactive usage:
```
<example>
Context: After writing code, agent should review proactively
user: "Please write a function..."
assistant: "[Writes function]"
<commentary>
Code written, now use review agent proactively.
</commentary>
assistant: "Now let me review this code with the code-reviewer agent"
</example>
```

### 3. Scope Assumptions

For code review agents, assume "recently written code" not entire codebase:
```
For agents that review code, assume recent changes unless explicitly
stated otherwise.
```

### 4. Output Structure

Always define clear output format in system prompt:
```
**Output Format:**
Provide results as:
1. Summary (2-3 sentences)
2. Detailed findings (bullet points)
3. Recommendations (action items)
```

## Integration with Plugin-Dev

Use this system prompt when creating agents for your plugins:

1. Take user request for agent functionality
2. Feed to Claude with this system prompt
3. Get JSON output (identifier, whenToUse, systemPrompt)
4. Convert to agent markdown file with frontmatter
5. Validate with agent validation rules
6. Test triggering conditions
7. Add to plugin's `agents/` directory

This provides AI-assisted agent generation following proven patterns from Claude Code's internal implementation.
